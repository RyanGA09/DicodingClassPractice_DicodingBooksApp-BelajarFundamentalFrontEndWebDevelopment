## Description

In this practice project, you will build a simple web application that allows users to display, add, and update a list of books. This project serves as an introduction to front-end web development, focusing on how to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) and handle user interactions.

Before starting the coding process, make sure to download the starter project from the provided link and extract it to a folder of your choice. Once extracted, open the project folder in your preferred code editor and install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install` in the terminal. After installation, use `npm run start-dev` to start the local server and open the project in your browser at `localhost:8080`.

The provided project is initially a basic template with placeholder functions in main.js. Your task will be to complete these functions (`getBook`, `insertBook`, `updateBook`, and `removeBook`) to make the application fully functional. These functions will interact with the DOM to display, add, update, and remove books from the list.

The main code to focus on includes rendering the list of books with `renderAllBooks` and setting up event listeners for adding and updating books. Additionally, you’ll work with form elements to handle user input for book details.

By completing this project, you’ll gain hands-on experience with JavaScript, the DOM, and asynchronous programming in front-end development.
